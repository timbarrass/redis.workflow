# redis.workflow
A simple structure for managing workflows in redis.


## Getting started
You'll need a local redis instance to store workflow state in -- try the MSOpenTech release on Windows. The example app bundled shows how tasks and workflows can be defined and submitted, and will submit ~10k workflows.
